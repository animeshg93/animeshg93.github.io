### My thoughts on software engineering so far ###

Software Engineering, from what I'd heard from dozens of people, was one of the classes every CS student should take before graduating from UT. Further inquiries from friends revealed that it was also a difficult, albeit a very interesting and useful, class. I didn't really see myself in Software Engineering, partly because getting into classes is a chore. So when registration started, I was able to secure spots in the 2 classes that I absolutely needed and was put on the waitlist for Software Engineering. I was 61 in the waitlist, so I figured my chances were really slim.

However, on the advice of my friend, I emailed my advisor, requesting him to put me in that class, as Software Engineering also satisfied the writing flag. 3 days later, I found out that I had found a spot in that class. I was eagerly looking forward to this class. On our first day in Professor Downing's class, he introduced us to a variety of software tools that we would making use over the course of the semester. His teaching style is also new to me, as he picks out students at random and asks him/her to describe what they thought a particular line of code did. It was a refreshing change from the other methods, because it forced me to evaluate unfamiliar Python code based on my past understanding of other programming languages. 

Professor Downing also thinks highly of team work as he encourages us to get to know people in our class. He also asked us to team up with someone to solve a particular problem during class. This is a good approach because if I am stuck at something, I have 30 other students to get help from. All in all, it has been a good first week, with promises of an exciting, but a difficult, semester ahead.
