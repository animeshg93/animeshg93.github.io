###Presentations and final exam

So this is it. I am done with another semester and I have again learned a whole lot of stuff that I was previously unaware about. This week, we had presentations from all the groups in our class. It was pretty awesome, getting to look and analyze the final product of all the groups. I came to learn a lot of cool tools that other groups had implemented in their work, making me realize again the enormous amount of tools available to us developers. In a way, among many ways, Software Engineering has been the most productive, fun, stressful and interesting class for me. Not even 439 was this fun.

Since we also had our finals due this week, a considerable amount of time was also devoted towards studying for them. Professor Downing always urger us to study in groups and before this final, I was content studying solo. But this time, it was great that I studied with my team, as I came to understand a lot of concepts by discussing those topics and having my doubts cleared by them. The final was pretty ok for me. Downing could've made it harder, but I'm glad he didn't.

I highly encourage future students to take this course if you get the chance. It is not the most perfect class, but you will learn a ton of things that will be highly useful for y'all in the coming years when you land a job somewhere. This class will teach you the value of team-work really good and will also get you to know a lot of tools about web development that you may be previously unaware about. In fact, this class is the reason why Full-Stack development has become my primary goal. 

All in all, this class was a great experience for me. I had a great professor to teach me a lot of concepts really well, I made some amazing friends and I helped build a fully functioning web application. Pretty neat, wouldn't ya say?

####Tip of the week
This class may seem stressful to some people and I know of a few others who have dropped out of this class. My advice to you would be this: This class is not easy. Choose your schedule carefully if you end up taking this class. Software Engineering requires a moderate-high time commitment, so it would be wise for you to make absolutely sure that you will be able to allocate appropriate time to this class for the whole semester. Select a team that has skills across the whole stack. Try to pick up a position that will have you move out of your comfort zone. Be dedicated towards your role, communicate well with your teammates, and above all, have fun in this class. Cheers and good luck!
