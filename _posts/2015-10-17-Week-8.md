###First phase of the Web Application###

We started the week off with a description of Project 3. Professor Downing went over the basics of the Project and what he expected from us. He gave us a list of tools to use for the frontend, backend and the database. Besides that, we also had to make use of a RESTful API to pull data for our project. Our team consisted of 5 members. We all had some knowledge in the tools that we had to use for this project so I was confident we wouldn't have any major trouble doing the first phase of this assignment. 

On Wednesday, we had a tech talk from Everett Toews, who showed us some of the cool things Rackspace is working on, including how to set up our own server. Then on Friday, we were introduced to MySQL. We talked in-depth about some of its more important keywords and then implemented the keyword SELECT in Python. All in all, this week was not that remarkable as the previous other weeks have been so far, but it could be a side result of having our test the previous week.

Our team started working on the project over the weekend. I was the lead Frontend guy. Frontend is the easiest thing ever, which is by itself, the best and worst thing about it. The best being that more than half the work is done for you by Bootstrap, while the worst thing is that it takes a lot of motivation to learn all about how that that work was done for you. But I stil genuinelt derived satisfaction from my code.
